            <p>The main character is a unicorn named Twilight Sparkle, who spends her days reading books without
                spending a single minute communicating with other ponies. Her mentor Princess Celestia, seeing that her
                beloved student is immersed in her studies, gives her the task of finding true friends. The heroine and
                her assistant dragon Spike go to Ponyville, where they meet loyal friends Rainbow Dash, generous Rarity,
                honest Applejack, kind Fluttershy and always cheerful Pinkie Pie. Together they find themselves in
                various situations, help each other and those around them to solve their problems, get acquainted with
                the inhabitants and corners of Equestria, occasionally quarrel over trifles, but they certainly make up.
